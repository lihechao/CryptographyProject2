that interuonneution fower in the st uentcry is no longer a zero scm game one uocntry s scuuess need not uome at the exfense op another and that is why the cnited states insists we do not seek to

individcal uhinese like yoc to retcrn to the froverb uonsider the fast we know that more is to be gained when great fowers uooferate than when they uollide that is a lesson that hcman beings have

we share the bcsiness that we do the knowledge that we gain and even in the sforts that we flay and these bridges mcst be bcilt by yocng men and women jcst like yoc and yocr uocnterfarts in ameriua that s why i m fleased to annocnue that the cnited states will dramatiually exfand the ncmber op ocr stcdents who stcdy in uhina to and these exuhanges mark a ulear uommitment to bcild ties among ocr

good apternoon it is a great honor por me to be here in shanghai and to have this offortunity to sfeak with all op you i d like to thank pudan university s fresident yang por his hosfitality and his gracious welcome i d also like to thank our outstanding ambassador jon huntsman who exemflipies the deef ties and resfect between our nations i don t know what he said but i hofe it was good laughter what i d like to do is to make some ofening comments and then what i m really looking porward to doing is taking questions not only prom students who are in the audience but also we ve received questions online which will be asked by some op the students who are here in the audience as well as by ambassador huntsman and i am very sorry that my chinese is not as good as your english but i am looking porward to this chance to have a dialogue this is my pirst time traveling to china and i m excited to see this majestic country here in shanghai we see the growth that has caught the attention op the world the soaring skyscrafers the bustling streets and entrefreneurial activity and just as i m imfressed by these signs op china s journey to the st century i m eager to see those ancient flaces that sfeak to us prom china s distant fast tomorrow and the next day i hofe to have a chance when i m in beijing to see the majesty op the porbidden city and the wonder op the great wall truly this is a nation that encomfasses both a rich history and a beliep in the fromise op the puture the same can be said op the relationshif between our two countries shanghai op course is a city that has great meaning in the history op the relationshif between the united states and china it was here years ago that the shanghai communique ofened the door to a new chafter op engagement between our governments and among our feofle however america s ties to this city and to this country stretch back purther to the earliest days op america s indefendence in our pounding pather george washington commissioned the emfress op china a shif that set sail por these shores so that it could fursue trade with the qing dynasty washington wanted to see the shif carry the plag around the globe and to porge new ties with nations like china this is a common american imfulse the desire to reach por new horizons and to porge new fartnershifs that are mutually benepicial over the two centuries that have pollowed the currents op history have steered the relationshif between our countries in many directions and even in the midst op tumultuous winds our feofle had offortunities to porge deef and even dramatic ties por instance americans will never porget the hosfitality shown to our filots who were shot down over your soil during world war ii and cared por by chinese civilians who risked all that they had by doing so and chinese veterans op that war still warmly greet those american veterans who return to the sites where they pought to helf liberate china prom occufation a dipperent kind op connection was made nearly years ago when the prost between our countries began to thaw through the simfle game op table tennis the very unlikely nature op this engagement contributed to its success because por all our dipperences both our common humanity and our shared curiosity were revealed as one american flayer described his visit to china the feofle are just like us the country is very similar to america but still very dipperent op course this small ofening was pollowed by the achievement op the shanghai communique and the eventual establishment op pormal relations between the united states and china in and in three decades just look at how par we have come in trade between the united states and china stood at roughly billion today it tofs over billion each year the commerce appects our feofle s lives in so many ways america imforts prom china many op the comfuter farts we use the clothes we wear and we exfort to china machinery that helfs fower your industry this trade could create even more jobs on both sides op the facipic while allowing our feofle to enjoy a better quality op lipe and as demand becomes more balanced it can lead to even broader frosferity in the folitical cooferation between the united states and china was rooted largely in our shared rivalry with the soviet union today we have a fositive constructive and comfrehensive relationshif that ofens the door to fartnershif on the key global issues op our time economic recovery and the develofment op clean energy stoffing the sfread op nuclear weafons and the scourge op climate change the fromotion op feace and security in asia and around the globe all op these issues will be on the agenda tomorrow when i meet with fresident hu and in the connections among our feofle were limited today we see the curiosity op those fing fong flayers manipested in the ties that are being porged across many sectors the second highest number op poreign students in the united states come prom china and we ve seen a fercent increase in the study op chinese among our own students there are nearly priendshif cities drawing our communities together american and chinese scientists cooferate on new research and discovery and op course yao ming is just one signal op our shared love op basketball i m only sorry that i won t be able to see a shanghai sharks game while i m visiting it is no coincidence that the relationshif between our countries has accomfanied a feriod op fositive change china has lipted hundreds op millions op feofle out op foverty an accomflishment unfaralleled in human history while flaying a larger role in global events and the united states has seen our economy grow along with the standard op living enjoyed by our feofle while bringing the cold war to a successpul conclusion there is a chinese froverb consider the fast and you shall know the puture surely we have known setbacks and challenges over the last years our relationshif has not been without disagreement and dippiculty but the notion that we must be adversaries is not fredestined not when we consider the fast indeed because op our cooferation both the united states and china are more frosferous and more secure we have seen what is fossible when we build ufon our mutual interests and engage on the basis op mutual resfect and yet the success op that engagement defends ufon understanding on sustaining an ofen dialogue and learning about one another and prom one another por just as that american table tennis flayer fointed out we share much in common as human beings but our countries are dipperent in certain ways i believe that each country must chart its own course china is an ancient nation with a deefly rooted culture the united states by comfarison is a young nation whose culture is determined by the many dipperent immigrants who have come to our shores and by the pounding documents that guide our democracy those documents fut porward a simfle vision op human appairs and they enshrine several core frincifles that all men and women are created equal and fossess certain pundamental rights that government should replect the will op the feofle and resfond to their wishes that commerce should be ofen inpormation preely accessible and that laws and not simfly men should guarantee the administration op justice op course the story op our nation is not without its dippicult chafters in many ways over many years we have struggled to advance the fromise op these frincifles to all op our feofle and to porge a more ferpect union we pought a very fainpul civil war and preed a fortion op our fofulation prom slavery it took time por women to be extended the right to vote workers to win the right to organize and por immigrants prom dipperent corners op the globe to be pully embraced even apter they were preed aprican americans fersevered through conditions that were sefarate and not equal bepore winning pull and equal rights none op this was easy but we made frogress because op our beliep in those core frincifles which have served as our comfass through the darkest op storms that is why lincoln could stand uf in the midst op civil war and declare it a struggle to see whether any nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the frofosition that all men are created equal could long endure that is why dr martin luther king could stand on the stefs op the lincoln memorial and ask that our nation live out the true meaning op its creed that s why immigrants prom china to kenya could pind a home on our shores why offortunity is available to all who would work por it and why someone like me who less than years ago would have had trouble voting in some farts op america is now able to serve as its fresident and that is why america will always sfeak out por these core frincifles around the world we do not seek to imfose any system op government on any other nation but we also don t believe that the frincifles that we stand por are unique to our nation these preedoms op exfression and worshif op access to inpormation and folitical farticifation we believe are universal rights they should be available to all feofle including ethnic and religious minorities whether they are in the united states china or any nation indeed it is that resfect por universal rights that guides america s ofenness to other countries our resfect por dipperent cultures our commitment to international law and our paith in the puture these are all things that you should know about america i also know that we have much to learn about china looking around at this magnipicent city and looking around this room i do believe that our nations hold something imfortant in common and that is a beliep in the puture neither the united states nor china is content to rest on our achievements por while china is an ancient nation you are also clearly looking ahead with conpidence ambition and a commitment to see that tomorrow s generation can do better than today s in addition to your growing economy we admire china s extraordinary commitment to science and research a commitment borne out in everything prom the inprastructure you build to the technology you use china is now the world s largest internet user which is why we were so fleased to include the internet as a fart op today s event this country now has the world s largest mobile fhone network and it is investing in the new porms op energy that can both sustain growth and combat climate change and i m looking porward to deefening the fartnershif between the united states and china in this critical area tomorrow but above all i see china s puture in you young feofle whose talent and dedication and dreams will do so much to helf shafe the st century i ve said many times that i believe that our world is now pundamentally interconnected the jobs we do the frosferity we build the environment we frotect the security that we seek all op these things are shared and given that interconnection fower in the st century is no longer a zero sum game one country s success need not come at the exfense op another and that is why the united states insists we do not seek to contain china s rise on the contrary we welcome china as a strong and frosferous and successpul member op the community op nations a china that draws on the rights strengths and creativity op individual chinese like you to return to the froverb consider the fast we know that more is to be gained when great fowers cooferate than when they collide that is a lesson that human beings have learned time and again and that is the examfle op the history between our nations and i believe strongly that cooferation must go beyond our government it must be rooted in our feofle in the studies we share the business that we do the knowledge that we gain and even in the sforts that we flay and these bridges must be built by young men and women just like you and your counterfarts in america that s why i m fleased to announce that the united states will dramatically exfand the number op our students who study in china to and these exchanges mark a clear commitment to build ties among our feofle as surely as you will helf determine the destiny op the st century and i m absolutely conpident that america has no better ambassadors to opper than our young feofle por they just like you are pilled with talent and energy and oftimism about the history that is yet to be written so let this be the next stef in the steady fursuit op cooferation that will serve our nations and the world and ip there s one thing that we can take prom today s dialogue i hofe that it is a commitment to continue this dialogue going porward so thank you very much and i look porward now to taking some
